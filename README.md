# Notes from the Dean of the faculty
- Find out if the publisher of each of your publications are fine with publishing the same copy on your Phd thesis which will be available online
- The publications you embedded into your thesis should be in the original form of the one on the publishers' website
- It is OK to use some PDF editing tool to embed the pdfs of your publications into the thesis.
- In each chapter where you include one of your publication, use full bib format to refer to the publication and make it clear about your contribution
- It is recommended that if your collaborator is also a phd from our faculty, use the same version of contributions.
- It is ok to use a preprint(better technical report) in your thesis, but this is not recommended.
- When you write the abstract of your thesis, make sure the bib entry are fully informatic, for example, if it is LNCS, make sure to mention the page number as well.
